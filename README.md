# Software-Engineering
These are college course assignments for Software Engineering. I had to create UML case, sequence, and deployment diagrams for an invention.  In this case, I chose a "smart thermostat" to diagram out.  This was a significant assignment and I earned a perfect score on it with excellent feedback.
